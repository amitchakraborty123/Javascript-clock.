
This is a simple clock made by HTML, CSS, Javascript.

The clock mainly build by js attribute- new Date(). then others function call to disply others.

In this project:-
HTML = use div, class, id, span. div class(main, one, two, three, clock) for style. span id(hour, minute, second) for js use.

CSS  = display the style(element position, shadow, hover, color etc).

js   = behind the logic of clock. new Date() = the full date. 
       then we use getHours() = hours; getMinutes() = minutes; getSeconds() = second. 
       var ampm = to set am/pm the clock. then add '0' before single digit and colon for separate. 
       then setInterval() = to refresh the clock.


Thank you.
