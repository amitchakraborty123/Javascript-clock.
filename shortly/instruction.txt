
This is a simple process to build a clock.

This is a simple clock made by HTML, CSS, Javascript.

The clock mainly build by js attribute- new Date(). then others function call to disply others.

In this project:-
HTML = use div, class, id, span. div class(main, one, two, three, clock) for style. span id(total) for js use.

CSS  = display the style(element position, shadow, hover, color etc).

js   = behind the logic of clock. new Date() = the full date. 
       then we use toLocaleString() with 12 hrs formate to display the fulltime. 
       main code = (fullDate.toLocaleString('en-US', { hour: 'numeric', minute: 'numeric', second: 'numeric', hour12: true })


Thank you.
